>can help you create a Dig Dug-like game in C++. 

Dig Dug is a classic arcade game where the player digs tunnels underground and defeats enemies by either pumping them up until they burst or by 
dropping rocks on them.

Let's create a simple console-based version of this game. I'll structure it with the basic elements:

1. A player character that can move and dig
2. Enemies that move through the tunnels
3. A grid-based map with dirt, rocks, and tunnels
4. A simple scoring system


> can you create digdug project in my home folder

> can you update game to use red color to identify location of player

> can you convert this application to graphic application that can run on X11

> can you replace squares with images similar to original pacman?

> can you add more sound effect for Pac-man munch and death similar to sound effects on this website https://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/pac-man/sounds
